# Extended Bash Prompt
This is an extension of the default ubuntu bash prompt which also shows:
* Current git branch (if in a git repo).
* Current selected docker host (if one has been selected with docker-machine).

## How to use
Simply source it:
``source bash_shell``

Or add it permanently by adding the above command to your ``.bash_aliases`` file.

Enjoy!

## Ideas for the future
Maybe make a status bar of the bottom line to show such information since the prompt tends to be pretty long.
